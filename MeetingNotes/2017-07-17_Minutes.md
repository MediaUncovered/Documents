## Data Gathering 

Data gathering has priority right now. We focus on the New York Times and the Moscow Times as these two newspapers are already configured and tested with the crawler @todorus set up.

**Action Point:** setup the server, starts crawling and save data in a database (T)

## Word Embedding Models

Based on the gathered data first word embedding models are trained and compared. Here, it is necessary to ensure scalability to avoid running into problems when datasets become larger! Therefore, parallel computing on Hadoop is a good solution.

**Action Point:** Ensure that gensim library used for word embedding models works with Hadoop (T + N)
