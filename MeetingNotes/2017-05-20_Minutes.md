## Previous meetings action points

#### (N) Write to funds for grants

Pretty succesful. We got into the final round of the AI Grant.

#### (N) Experiment with data

No time yet, going to refactor code instead

#### (T) Develop a specialized crawler for a few websites to gather a lot of data quickly
* Found two newspapers (New York Times, Russian Post)
* Working on the crawler, looking good. Gonna try to get it done this month, will update on this.

#### (T) Develop a generic crawler using RSS feeds to gather good data over time
* specialized crawler is already pretty generic, probably completely reusable
* no time to work on this month, will be next month

## Pitch TODO's
We did all of them :D

## Pitch retrospective

#### What went Well
* Listen, understand and build upon it
* Practice, fail, improve
* Not aiming to be perfect is perfectly fine
* If you don't know how to do it, try it (and get experience/insight)
* If you disagree, look for proof


#### What could be improved
* Communicate what is important to you
* Use SMART goals. If we have a goal, we know what to expect. If not, then we don't have to expect it.
* Request a meeting when you want to talk about something, and announce the subject(s) beforehand

## Josh
Natalie has been talking to Josh, who has already given us some good pointers
for the project. Josh is studying the AI master in Nijmegen and is deeply into
deep learning. Josh is excited about the project.

# Action points

* (N) talk to Josh and setup a meeting.
* (N) refactor the code that she used for her research master
* (T) continue to work on the specialized crawler and update Natalie about progress
