## Hadoop

@todorus has looked into how to process big data and found a flexible solution in
the Hadoop framework. He also has ordered hardware for a small development setup,
based on four Raspberry PI's.

#### Cons
* It uses the MapReduce structure of processing data. So any algorithm needs to
be (re)written to a MapReduce problem
* Our primary coding language is Python and Hadoops is Java

#### Pro's
* Pretty much solves all the problems that come with distributed computing and
  storage
* Very rich ecosystem of applications and libraries that are compatible with it

## Development storage

@Tilana needs to get data asap, to get started on experimenting with different
models. It will take time to research and setup a Hadoop cluster, so in the
meantime we need to use a more conventional approach.

## Action points
* look into how to get Word2Vec running on Hadoop and present an interface to
Python (T)
* setup a datastore for development of the models. Preferably an SQL compliant
one, as @Tilana is familiar with SQL. (T)
