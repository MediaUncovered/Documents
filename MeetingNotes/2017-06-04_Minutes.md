## Previous action points

* Meetings with Josh (N) - put on hold for governance model
* Code refactoring (N) - done! Functionalities are sorted out and tested
* work on specialized crawler (T) - implemented tests for finding articles of the Moscow Times and the New York Times. Extraction of title, publication date and body works.

## Governance Model

#### Motivation

To encourage people to contribute to a project it is necessary to: 
* have a detailed project description with well defined milestones 
* specify open tasks and issues to work on
* define contribution guidelines to manage expectations on both sides
* make contribution easy 
* be trustworthiness - the seriousness of a project is reflected by its code, vision and methodology
* acknowledge interest in the project and any form of contribution
* give fast feedback and provide well-argued decision


#### Roles

* Core Team - for efficient decision making
* Contributors - developers or non-developers that add value to the project by discussing ideas and implementing features 
* Users - journalists, researchers or other users of the product with feature or newspaper requests, concerns and support questions


## Further Points

#### Funding

Unfortunately, we did not get the AI grant. 
However, before applying for other funding we focus on coding to reach the first milestone

#### First Milestone

* collection of a valid dataset
* publication of trained model
* analysis to showcase different research possibilities 

#### Coding convention

* comment on issues and use pull request to establish a communication cultur and get a better understanding of each others code 
* use issue numbers when committing to establish a link between code and discussion


## Action points

* Formulate Governance Model (T)
* Formulate Project Description (N)
* linking crawler to database and deploy to servers (time estimateabout two weeks) (T)
* literature research on word embeddings (N)
