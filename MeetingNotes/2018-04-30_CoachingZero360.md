### 2018-04-30 Coaching with Simon from Zero360

I had a really nice online chat with Simon in which we focused on two topics:

#### (1) User Testing

In oder to build a tool/product that fits the needs of potential users it is crucial to understand their goals, motivation, associations, as well as their workflow and the problems they face.
The main approaches for user testing include qualitative and quantitative research: While quantitative research reveals statistics about how well (fast, accurate,...) a user is able to complete a certain task, qualitative research focuses more on understanding and observing workflows and their struggles.

*Suggestions*: qualitative user testing, about 1 hour, 6-7 users from potentially different user groups, be at least 2 people conducting the testing to not miss important questions and answers.

**Preparation:**

- use the [value proposition canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas) to understand create assumptions about the user. General approach: first collect, then filter...
- use these assumptions to create hypothesis to connect your tool to the user (e.g. potential benefits, ways of solving a problem)

**User testing:**

- General questions about their workflow when starting investigating a topic, writing an article, etc.
- Ask about problems and challenges (focus on past and present moment), 'what was your work around or what (tool) would you have needed?'
- Introduction of the tool: 'Imagine, you have.....'
  Present a first prototype, mockups or drawings
  'What do you think? And  __why__ is this interesting/difficult/useful/not useful,...'

**Evaluation:**

- combine user reactions, reflect on them and adjust roadmap accordingly



#### (2) Remote Working Culture

Team projects are motivating and inspiring, but also pose a challenge as goals, expectations, as well as commitment between team members might differ. Working remotely, adds on these challenges.
Here, are some ideas to ensure a balanced, pleasant and efficient working culture:

- set together a realistic roadmap starting from the final goal (e.g. demo day). What is our mission?
- identify milestones to achieve these goals and divide these milestones in smaller chunks of work with team members being responsible for them
- meet up regularly to update on progress, discuss issues and check/redefine roadmap
- talk about what is on your way (stumbling blocks)
- work together, e.g. organize small online hackathons
