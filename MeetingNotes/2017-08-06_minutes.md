@todorus wasn't too impressed by it. It does data processing on a single machine,
while we have a scalability requirement to keep in mind. There are frameworks
that have this built in. It could be interesting to look at in the future to
parallelize this, but it would need a significant advantage over big data
frameworks (like map-reduce for example).

## Experiment with model

@tilana is excited about the data and has starting working with it. The data
seems to be of good quality already and needs some slight filtering for better
results.

## Spending money on servers

@todorus is spending money on servers right now, which has @tilana worried,
because money changes things. It feels more unbalanced. Especially the fact that
@todorus didn't tell he was spending money on servers worried @tilana.

@todorus doesn't share the issue, as he sees it as an investment into the
project. This could be time, hardware or money and we have never worried about
how much time the other is putting in, compared to our own. He sees it as a
donation to Media Uncovered.

## AI Grant

The AI Grant has a second round. We should reapply for it, as it would take
virtually no effort with a possible gain.

## Action points
* Scraper for NYTimes Archive (T)
* Train the model (N)
* Think about what would be ok to spend on Media Uncovered (T)
* Apply to the second round of the AI Grant (N)
