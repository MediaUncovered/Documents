## General Communications

Over the last few weeks we noticed some tendencies in our way of interacting which we want to actively work on to ensure a respectful communication and consistency with our principles:
* Value contribution and time of team members:
  - feedback (including saying 'I have no time for feedback') is crucial
  - differentiate project update from too detailed information outside of the team members' interest
  - set a reasonable time frame for starting the team meeting
  - communicate reasons or arguments - not decision
  - if necessary request a team meeting to solve major discussion points 
* Commit to Project Polices: 
  - Openness: resume writing and publishing meeting notes
  - 1 Day-Submission-Puffer for (grant) deadlines


## Code of Conduct - Pull Request

Pull requests are owned by the contributor who opens them. He or she is responsible for the extent and implementation of the specified feature. While others can give feedback or request changes via a code review or additional comments, commits to the pull request are undesirable. General rule is the shorter the PR, the easier it is to work on, review and merge.
