# Media Uncovered

Free and diverse media is necessary for a well-informed public and a functioning society.
However, objective reporting is not possible and sometimes newspapers even favor a certain ideology or political direction.

Even though we are not consciously aware of the presence of reporting biases, such as the tendency to favor arguments of a political party or to constantly set a country in a negative context, they do have significant influence on our world view.
Knowing these biases helps to critically reflect the reliability and trustworthiness of an article.

We build a free and open-source tool to uncover such hidden biases. 
Neural networks are able to map the content of a newspaper in a vector space such that relations and similarities of words are captured. The resulting word embeddings enable us to detect consistent reporting biases, compare topic coverage and language usage of newspapers and even provide a basis to assess media variety in a country.

We want readers to explore the content and language of newspapers and critically reflect their sources of information. Journalist and organizations can use the tool to detect and analyze underlying biases in newspapers, investigate the language used when reporting about a specific topic, find evidence for media consolidation and advocate for a free and diverse media.
