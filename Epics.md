# Epics

###  'One - Newspaper' Prototype

- collect sufficient articles from one newspaper
- build word embedding model (word2vec, fastText, Glove, etc.)
- visualize model for an interactive exploration (similar words, analogies)
- documentation (concept of word embeddings, example analysis)



### 'Multi - Newspaper' Prototype

* compare two newspaper based on their corresponding word embedding
* develop methods to select specific axis (good - bad, male-female) and list of words mapped on axis
* add possibility to select different newspapers



### User Interviews

- Journalists, political scientists ,..
- What do they expect from such a tool? What is the most important thing (links to orignial articles)?
- Main axis of interests (people, usage of language, comparison of )
- What is their background in programming/machine learning? Familiarity with word embeddings
- UX



### Scale Up

+ apply scraper to other newspapers
+ adapt infrastructure  



### Publicity

- conferences, twitter, website



### Bonus

- build articles database and connect the word embedding visualization to articles which contain the corresponding words frequently (--> check legal consequences)
