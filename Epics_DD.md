## Epics Demoday

In the first week of September (exact date will be added later) the Demo Day of the Prototype Fund will take place. Till then want to achieve a Media Uncovered demo with the following features:

- an online application where a user can select 5 different newspaper models
- each model comes with metadata (how many articles are included, when they were collected, how the model was trained, ...)
- there is an explorer mode (tensorflow projector) where users see a visualisation of the model and can interact with it
- there is a keyword mapping visualization (own viewer) to map keywords, e.g. professions such as banker, cto, programmer, nurse,... onto a certain axis, e.g. the gender axis male vs. female
- user guide to explain the key concept behind the visualizations and gives an introduction to get started
- example analysis based on keyword mapping and word associations






### User stories

As an interested newspaper reader, I want to compare the language and words different newspapers use regarding a specific topic such as the refugee crisis or climate change.

As a non-technical person interested in media coverage I want an intuitive interaction with the tool and a simple and understandable explanation of the underlying methods, as well as help on how to interpret my findings.

As a journalist I want to detect biases in newspapers, these can be related to political affiliations, gender stereotypes, moral ideals, ....

As a journalist who uses Media Uncovered to analyse the reporting of newspapers, I want to be sure that the machine learning models and the data these are trained on is reliable.
